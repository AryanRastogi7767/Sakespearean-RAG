You look pale, and gaze, And put on fear, and cast yourself in wonder, To see the strange impatience of the heavens. But if you would consider the true cause 65 Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts, Why birds and beasts from quality and kind, Why old men, fools, and children calculate, Why all these things change from their ordinance, Their natures, and preformèd faculties, 70 To monstrous quality—why, you shall find That heaven hath infused them with these spirits To make them instruments of fear and warning Unto some monstrous state. Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man 75 Most like this dreadful night, That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars As doth the lion in the Capitol; A man no mightier than thyself or me In personal action, yet prodigious grown, 80 And fearful, as these strange eruptions are. CASCA ’Tis Caesar that you mean, is it not, Cassius? CASSIUS: Let it be who it is. For Romans now Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors. But, woe the while, our fathers’ minds are dead, 85 And we are governed with our mothers’ spirits. Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish. CASCA: Indeed, they say the Senators tomorrow Mean to establish Caesar as a king, And he shall wear his crown by sea and land 90 In every place save here in Italy. CASSIUS: I know where I will wear this dagger then; Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius. Therein, you gods, you make the weak most strong; Therein, you gods, you tyrants do defeat. 95 Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass, Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron, Can be retentive to the strength of spirit; But life, being weary of these worldly bars, Never lacks power to dismiss itself. 100 If I know this, know all the world besides, That part of tyranny that I do bear I can shake off at pleasure. Thunder still. CASCA: So can I. So every bondman in his own hand bears 105 The power to cancel his captivity.",

Yet Caesar shall go forth, for these predictions Are to the world in general as to Caesar. 30 CALPHURNIA: When beggars die there are no comets seen; The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes. CAESAR: Cowards die many times before their deaths; The valiant never taste of death but once. 35 Of all the wonders that I yet have heard, It seems to me most strange that men should fear, Seeing that death, a necessary end, Will come when it will come. What say the augurers? 40 SERVANT: They would not have you to stir forth today. Plucking the entrails of an offering forth, They could not find a heart within the beast. CAESAR: The gods do this in shame of cowardice. Caesar should be a beast without a heart 45 If he should stay at home today for fear. No, Caesar shall not. Danger knows full well That Caesar is more dangerous than he. We are two lions littered in one day, And I the elder and more terrible. 50 And Caesar shall go forth."
