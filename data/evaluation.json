    "category": "analytical",
    "question": "How does Cassius manipulate Brutus into joining the conspiracy?",
    "ideal_answer": "Cassius uses several tactics: he appeals to Brutus's honor and reputation, plants forged letters supposedly from Roman citizens expressing concern about Caesar, uses flattery to make Brutus feel responsible for Rome's fate, and exploits Brutus's republican ideals and fear of tyranny.",

    "ideal_answer": "Brutus speaks in prose, appeals to logic and Roman honor, and asks the crowd to judge him by their wisdom. He is direct and expects his reputation to speak for itself. Antony speaks in verse, uses emotional appeals, repeats 'Brutus is an honorable man' ironically, shows Caesar's wounds and will, and manipulates the crowd's emotions. Brutus's speech is too rational while Antony's is masterfully persuasive.",

    "ideal_answer": "Omens serve as warnings that are ignored: the Soothsayer's warning about the Ides of March, Calpurnia's nightmares, the strange weather and supernatural events. They represent fate trying to intervene, but human hubris (Caesar's) and determination (the conspirators') override these warnings. Caesar's ghost appearing to Brutus suggests fate's inevitable justice.",

    "ideal_answer": "Caesar presents a strong, fearless public persona, refusing to show weakness before others. However, privately he is influenced by Calpurnia's dreams and fears. His public dismissal of the Soothsayer conflicts with possible private concerns. This duality between his public image and private doubts ultimately contributes to his downfall.",

    "id": 31,
    "category": "analytical",
    "question": "What is the significance of Brutus being called 'the noblest Roman of them all' by Antony at the end?",
    "ideal_answer": "Antony acknowledges that unlike the other conspirators who acted out of envy, Brutus genuinely believed he was serving the common good. This recognition shows that despite opposing Brutus, Antony respects his sincere motives and integrity. It's tragic irony: Brutus's nobility and idealism led to his downfall.",

    "id": 32,
    "category": "rhetorical",
    "question": "What rhetorical devices does Antony use in his funeral oration to turn the crowd against the conspirators?",
    "ideal_answer": "Antony uses verbal irony (repeatedly calling Brutus 'honorable' while undermining him), rhetorical questions ('Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?'), emotional appeals (showing Caesar's wounds and will), repetition ('ambitious' and 'honorable man'), and strategic pauses to let the crowd's emotions build. He also uses concrete examples of Caesar's generosity to counter claims of ambition.",

    "id": 33,
    "category": "character",
    "question": "How does Cassius's character differ from Brutus's, and how does this affect the conspiracy?",
    "ideal_answer": "Cassius is practical, cunning, and driven by personal envy, while Brutus is idealistic, honorable, and motivated by principle. Cassius understands human nature and politics better, but defers to Brutus's moral authority. Brutus's idealistic decisions (sparing Antony, letting him speak) prove disastrous, showing how nobility without pragmatism can fail in politics.",

  {
    "id": 34,
    "category": "thematic",
    "question": "What does the play suggest about the relationship between fate and free will?",
    "ideal_answer": "The play presents a complex interplay: omens and prophecies suggest a predetermined fate, yet characters make choices that seal their destinies. Caesar could have heeded warnings but chose not to. Brutus chose to join the conspiracy. The play suggests that while fate may set circumstances, human choices and character flaws (hubris, idealism) determine outcomes.",

  {
    "id": 35,
    "category": "analytical",
    "question": "Why does Brutus refuse to swear an oath with the other conspirators?",
    "ideal_answer": "Brutus believes that their cause is so just and their honor so strong that no oath is necessary. He says honest men don't need oaths, and Romans' word should be enough. This reflects his idealistic nature and his belief that they are acting purely for Rome's good, not personal gain. It also shows his naivety about human nature and politics.",
